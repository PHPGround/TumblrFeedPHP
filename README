<h2>Get Tumblr Feed (PHP)</h2>

	This is a simple and very basic script to grab a user's Tumblr feed using the Tumblr API and JSON. It can be adapted in several ways
	to make it more usable for a particular requirement. For example, as it sits now, it directly outputs HTML code via 'echo' PHP statements,
	but can just as easily grab the content and return it to create the dynamic HTML.
